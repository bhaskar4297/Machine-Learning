The analysis aims to predict popularity score of a song based on several features. Since popularity is an integer value, we will employ a regression method. Nonetheless, before diving deeper we need to look at the big picture, get, clean, discover and visualize data for insights. Following this, we will prepare the data for our regression analysis, select and train the model and would ultimately fine-tune it for accuracy. Lastly, we will present our findings and compare with our performance in Kaggle InClass competition. A prime focus of our analysis would be to provide justification for any tool or method we employ.
